## 🔍 Key Insight: 

1️⃣Between 2014 and 2017, the company experienced consistent revenue growth; however, profit margins remained low due to high operational costs, particularly expenses related to furniture, such as tables and chairs, as well as phone equipment.

2️⃣The Western region generated the highest sales volume and also recorded the highest return rate, 15% of total orders in that area, despite having shorter average delivery times compared to other regions.


3️⃣ In 2017, the company served a total of 793 customers, achieving a remarkable retention rate of 99.4%. This translated to an average profit of $361 per customer. The Consumer segment accounted for the largest share of total business sales.
