## 🔍 Key Insight: 

1. Between 2014 and 2017, the company experienced consistent revenue growth; however, profit margins remained low due to high operational costs, particularly expenses related to furniture, such as tables and chairs, as well as phone equipment.
2. the "table" had the second-highest product return rate (9%) and generated negative profit
3. **The Western region** generated the highest sales volume and also recorded the **highest return rate**, 15% of total orders in that area, despite having **the shortest average delivery times** compared to other regions.
4. In 2017, the company served a total of 793 customers, achieving a remarkable retention rate of 99.4%. This translated to an average profit of $361 per customer. The Consumer segment accounted for the largest share of total business sales.
